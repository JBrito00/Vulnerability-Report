## Learning Burp Suite and Web Application Security Testing

This repository documents the steps and results of HTTP interception and performing a web application security scan. The goal of this activity was to recreate the PortSwigger Burp Suite tutorial, but since I only have access to the Community Edition, I opted to use OWASP ZAP as well to scan a URL and achieve similar results.

### Prerequisites
- **2 CPU cores, 4 GB RAM**
- **Java 11 or higher**
- **Burp Suite**: Installed on your machine.
- **OWASP ZAP**: Installed on your machine.

I conducted these activities on a Linux system within a VirtualBox environment, but similar results can be obtained on other operating systems.

## Steps

1. **Intercept HTTP Traffic**:
   - Started by intercepting HTTP traffic using the proxy tool in Burp Suite. The goal was to intercept HTTP requests while accessing the site [PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net) and analyze the History tab to become familiar with the tools.

2. **Account Creation and Exploit**:
   - Created an account on the PortSwigger website to access some credits for purchasing items from a fake web shop. Using the username and password provided in the guide, I gained access to 100 store credits. The objective was to buy a 1337 credit jacket by intercepting the POST request when adding the jacket to the cart and altering its value in the body parameter to 1 (since the value is in cents). This exploit is only possible using Burp Suite, as it cannot be performed solely using the browser.

3. **Testing with Repeater**:
   - Set the target to scope and sent requests to the Repeater tool. The goal was to test different types of responses by changing the query parameters.

4. **OWASP ZAP Scan**:
   - Since accessing the scanner tool in Burp Suite requires a paid license, I used OWASP ZAP to scan the malicious website [ginandjuice.shop](http://ginandjuice.shop) (**Danger**). In the **Quick Start** tab, I entered the URL and clicked on "Attack." After the spidering process, ZAP automatically performed an active scan on the discovered endpoints. The active scan tests the endpoints for various vulnerabilities by sending crafted requests and analyzing the responses. After the scan was complete, I accessed the **Alerts** tab, which showed some low and medium findings, as well as one high-severity vulnerability.

The results are detailed in the PDF file in this repository, which contains the vulnerability report produced by OWASP ZAP.

## Conclusion

Overall, this exercise underscores the importance of using a combination of manual and automated tools in the security assessment process to ensure a thorough evaluation of web application vulnerabilities. Mixing different tools is also a good learning experience to be prepared real world situations.
